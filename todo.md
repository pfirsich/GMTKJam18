# Post-Jam Ideas
* Undo (how to limit this? Grant an undo for every Tetris?)
* Only show the timer on the controls on the first start
* Add a way to show the controls screen in-game (in the escape-menu?)
* I shifted the for the score system to indicate "how much" a player did and not "how well". Maybe I should go super explicit on this and just show the number of lines in total and the number of full lines and that's it.

# Probably not
* ufo -> glitch shader
* creative mode: choose the next block and export as photo
* particles (block spawn, block land, rotation?)
* asteroids
* height-dependent block color?
* (use spritebatch for grid rendering)
* outlines for blocks
